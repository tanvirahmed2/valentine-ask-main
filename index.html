              <p><strong>My Love, Anaya,</strong></p>

              <p>
                To begin with, I love you with a depth and passion that I have felt for no one else in this life and if that astonishes you, it astonishes me as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                My love, on this day of love, I am sorry that I am not with you, holding your hand. You always say that you want to see me and get to know me, and yet fate has shaped our story in such a way that we have never met. Still, all I hope for and all I pray for is that one day we will be together properly, truly as husband and wife.
              </p>

              <p>
                The thing is, Anaya, even though I haven’t met you, I love you so much. And I know that love doesn’t ask permission from distance or time. It simply exists, quietly and fiercely, the way you exist in my heart.

              <p>
                All my life, every step I took, every choice I made, every road that led me to this moment I walked it without you. I lived those years alone, building a life that did not yet know your name. And that, my love, was my loss.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that I have found you, I want nothing in this world more than to walk the rest of my life with you. Every dream, every struggle, every ordinary day and extraordinary moment I want them all to be shared with you, until death does us part. That will be my gain.
              </p>

              <p>
                I would give up everything I lived without you for even a single moment by your side to hear your laugh, to listen to your voice, to see your eyes, your hair, your lips, to feel your presence. But more than anything, it is your mind that captivates me your thoughts, your words, the way you see the world. Loving you feels like discovering something endlessly beautiful, something I am endlessly grateful to explore.

                I must be with you. I want nothing else in this life than to be with you to listen to you and to watch you. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to be together? Really together.
              </p>

              <p>
                You once asked me a silly question, again and again why do I love you? Your beautiful voice. Your beauty. To argue with you. To laugh with you. The glory of you.
              </p>

              <p>
                I cannot envisage a life without loving you with a depth and passion that I have felt for no one else in this life. And I am glad that I love you.
